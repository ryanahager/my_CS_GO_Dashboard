# my_CS_GO_Dashboard
This is an Excel dashboard I built to visualize several years of my Counter-Strike: Global Offensive match data. It’s interactive, easy to navigate, and designed to highlight trends and insights from my games.

What it shows:
Total games played
Victory ratio
Overall performance ratio across all maps
Map distribution pie chart
Win/Loss pie chart
Horizontal bar chart showing performance ratio for each map, separated by team side

Interactive buttons:
Insight – Shows per-match data along with custom formulas that generate extra charts (scroll down on this page to see) and highlight interesting patterns
Data – Shows the complete raw dataset, ready for further analysis or use in SQL queries

Why I made it:
To practice collecting, organizing multi-year data, and just for fun
To build an Excel dashboard that is both functional and visually clear
To design simple navigation tools in Excel so the file is easy to explore

How to use it:
Open the Excel file and start on the Dashboard sheet.
Use the buttons in the right-hand frozen column to switch between the Insight view and the full Data view.
Explore the charts and metrics to see how the formulas and visuals work together.
